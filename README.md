## Project Structure & Organization

A modular approach is key. Separate your code into distinct packages based on functionality. This aligns with the "modular architecture" and "package management" topics in your syllabus.

- com.company.crm: This package would hold the core business logic and data models for the CRM.
- com.company.ordermanagement: This handles all order-related processes, including creating, updating, and viewing orders.
- com.company.inventory: This manages all inventory-related data, like stock levels and product information.
- com.company.ui: This package is for all your JavaFX user interface files (controllers, FXML files). This separation makes it easy to change the UI without touching the core logic.
- com.company.main: This contains your main application entry point.

Use a build automation tool like Maven or Gradle from the beginning. Your syllabus mentions both (Session 20), and they are essential for managing dependencies and building your project.

## Conceptualizing the Project: OOP & Design Patterns

Think about the problem in terms of objects. This is "thinking in objects" from your syllabus (Session 12).

Customer: An object with attributes like name, ID, contact information. It will have methods to update its details.

Product: An object with a name, SKU, price, and current stock level.

Order: An object representing a customer's purchase, containing a list of Product objects, a total price, and a status (e.g., pending, shipped, delivered).

Inventory: This could be a class that holds a collection of all Product objects and methods for adding/removing products or updating stock. This is where you would apply a Singleton design pattern (Session 26) to ensure only one instance of the inventory exists.

Interfaces & Abstract Classes: Use these to define contracts for your objects. For example, an InventoryManager interface could define methods like addProduct(Product product) and updateStock(Product product, int quantity). Your concrete InventoryService class would then implement this interface. This aligns with Session 16 on abstract classes and interfaces.

Separation of Concerns: Apply the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.

Model: Your core business objects (Customer, Product, Order). They hold the data and logic.

View: The JavaFX UI components that the user sees.

Controller: Classes that handle user input and update the model and view. This is a crucial concept from Session 22.
